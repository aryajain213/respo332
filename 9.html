            Wondering what makes hydroxychloroquine so important in treating COVID-19 cases?
            The drug has been a subject of much interest globally due to its role in treatment and prevention of
            coronavirus-induced COVID-19.
            An IE report states that hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug which is less toxic than chloroquine and
            is prescribed in certain cases and also to patients of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
            The IE report quoted a study from International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA), which stated that
            among the 20 patients to whom the drug was administered, there was a significant viral carriage reduction.
            Moreover, the average carrying duration was also found to be much lower than in untreated patients, the
            study was quoted as saying by IE. The study also added that in cases where Azithromycin, which is an
            antibiotic, was added to hydroxychloroquine, the elimination of the virus was more efficient.
            While the study was not well received due to its small scale, by the end of March, President Trump had
            started saying that the drug would be a “game changer” in the fight against COVID-19 and started pushing for
            it, IE reported.
            INDIA,who is the largest producer of HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE ,has assured other countries to help and will export
            these drugs to those who are mostly dependent on India's capabilities.
